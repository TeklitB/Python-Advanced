LAB

Estimated time
10-20 minutes

Level of difficulty
Medium

Objectives
improving the student's skills in operating with special methods
Scenario
Extend the class implementation prepared in the previous lab to support the addition and subtraction of integers to time interval objects;
to add an integer to a time interval object means to add seconds;
to subtract an integer from a time interval object means to remove seconds.

Hint
in the case when a special method receives an integer type argument, instead of a time interval object, create a new time interval object based on the integer value.
Test data:

the time interval (tti) is hours=21, minutes=58, seconds=50
the expected result of addition (tti + 62) is 21:59:52
the expected result of subtraction (tti - 62) is 21:57:48
